## Description

Haven is a video call and chat messaging app that connects people across the globe. We've built a real-time communication platform that seamlessly integrates WebRTC and Socket.IO to enable low-latency video calls.

### Technical details

- **WebRTC**: Enables low-latency, real-time communication between users.
- **Socket.IO**: Provides real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers.
- **TensorFlow.js**: Used for object detection, profanity filters, and other AI-powered features.

### Features

- **Real-time Video Calls**: Join virtual meetings with friends, family, or colleagues.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Protect your privacy with end-to-end encryption.
- **Profanity Filters**: Ensure a safe and respectful communication environment.
- **AI-Powered Features**: Stay connected with AI-powered features like object detection and sentiment analysis.

### Architecture

- **Pub/Sub Model**: Scale your application horizontally with a Publisher-Subscriber model.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Built on top of containerized and cloud-native technologies.
- **Continuous Integration/Deployment**: Automated testing and deployment processes ensure a smooth application lifecycle.

### Roadmap

- **Audio/Video Call Recording**: Enable users to record their conversations.
- **Screen Sharing**: Share your screen with others for presentations or collaboration.
- **AI-Powered Chatbots**: Integrate chatbots for customer support and other purposes.
- **Virtual Whiteboard**: Collaborate with others using a virtual whiteboard.
